# Diabetes Prediction Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook contains code and analysis for predicting diabetes using Data Mining Techniques.

## Overview

In this notebook, we perform the following steps:

- Data exploration and visualization.
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values.
- Model selection and training, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Model evaluation for one model(knn).
- Deploy the saved model amd predict the results using flask.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- flask

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook using JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.
